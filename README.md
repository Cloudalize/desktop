# Cloudalize Desktop Client

This client can be used to log in to your account and launch your desktops. For macOS, your desktops are added to the dock menu for easy access and on Windows you can create desktop shortcuts.

The receiver is installed automatically, so you don't need to install any additional software manually for our client to work.

This repository is used as a release channel, the source code is proprietary.
